  The following styles from the original Certification.css have been migrated to Tailwind CSS classes 
  or are handled by inline styles in the Certificates.jsx component:

  .navi
  .navi ul
  .navi ul li .link (now .link-item in JSX)
  .navi ul li .link > img (styles applied directly to SVG or its container)
  .hover-reveal (most properties are now Tailwind classes or inline styles for dynamic values)
  .hover-reveal img (now .hidden-img in JSX, most properties are Tailwind or inline)

  Media query adjustments have also been applied directly using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., md:).
*/

/* Minimal CSS for hover-reveal if absolutely necessary beyond Tailwind + inline styles for transitions */
/* However, transitions are already defined in Certficates.jsx using Tailwind classes like:
   - For hover-reveal div: transition-all duration-500 ease-out
   - For Image component: transition-transform duration-400 ease-out
   So, explicit transition rules here might be redundant.
